Use on Windows:
===============
You will need to convert the png files into ico files. Ico files will be created once the missing sizes are created. Some docks and softwares can directly use the png files.
To edit the source files, you will need a vector graphic software such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.


Use on Mac:
===========
You will need to convert the png files into icns files. Icns files will be created once the missing sizes are created.
To edit the source files, you will need a vector graphic software such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.


Use on GNU/Linux:
=================
Most modern and up to date GNU/Linux distributions can natively view and scale svg files. Replace the appropriate files in your icon theme of choice. I recommend you use the png files if scalability is not needed.
To edit the source files, I recommend you install Inkscape. Adobe Illustrator is said to work through Wine.
