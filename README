Use on Windows:
===============
The current version is not yet complete, you will need to convert the png files into ico files. Some docks and softwares can directly use the png files.
To edit the source files, you will need a vector graphic software such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.

Use on GNU/Linux:
=================
Most modern and up to date GNU/Linux distributions can natively view and scale svg files. Replace the appropriate files in your icon theme of choice. I recommend you use the png files if scalability is not needed.
To edit the source files, I recommend you install Inkscape. Adobe Illustrator is said to work through Wine.
