Use on Windows:
===============
Ico files should be available.
If there is no corresponding ico file to an icon that can be found in the 'icns', 'png', 'svg' or 'src' folders, most likely some sizes are missing and still need to be designed and/or reworked. If every size has been designed, ico files will soon be available.

It is also possible to convert png files or icns files into ico files using dedicated softwares such as IcoFX or IconWorkshop. Graphics software such as Adobe Photoshop or The Gimp are also capable of creating ico files.

To edit the source files, you will need a vector graphic software such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.

Use on GNU/Linux:
=================
Png and svg fles are available.
Replace the appropriate files in your icon theme of choice. I recommend you use the png files if scalability is not needed.

To edit the source files, I recommend you install Inkscape. Adobe Illustrator is said to work through Wine.
